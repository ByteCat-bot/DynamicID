This is the official implementation of DynamicID, a framework that generates visually harmonious image featuring **multiple individuals**. Each person in the image can be specified through user-provided reference images, and most notably, our method enables **independent control of each individual's facial expression** via text prompts. Hope you have fun with this demo!

## üîç Abstract

Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have spurred interest in personalized human image generation. Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often struggle with **limited multi-ID usability** and **inadequate facial editability**. 

We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 

- Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 

- Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which applies feature-space manipulation to effectively disentangle and reconfigure facial motion and identity features, supporting flexible facial editing.

- A task-decoupled training paradigm that reduces data dependency

- A curated VariFace-10k facial dataset, comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. 

Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.

The proposed framework is architected around two core components: SAA and IMR. (a) In the anchoring stage, we jointly optimize the SAA and a face encoder to establish robust single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation capabilities. (b) Subsequently in the reconfiguration stage, we freeze these optimized components and leverage them to train the IMR for flexible and fine-grained facial editing.

## üöÄ Checkpoint

1. Download the pretrained Stable Diffusion v1.5 checkpoint from [Stable Diffusion v1.5 on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5).

2. Download our SAA-related and IMR-related checkpoints from  [DynamicID Checkpoints on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meteorite2023/DynamicID).
